Comments	    :
Taking a break from my studies (my exams are about 2 weeks away) and surfing the Net I came accross a uniqe and striking image of Rei. Having turned into a wallpaper for my desktop, I was wondering if it could be make into a matching Winamp skin and here it is.

If you are interested in obtaining the other skins I've created, point your internet browser to 'http://magicweaver.cjb.net'

This skin is designed specially for Winamp 2.02 and above, I'm not sure if it will work properly for the first couple of releases of Winamp 2. As the guys who designed Winamp made some changes in the playlist editor from the previous version, so you might notice some errors in there.

I couldn't get to imginative with the playlist editor 'cause it's a scalable window. If I smacked an image there it would look really ugly unless you fixed it to the size it was designed. Instead I designed a playlist skin to match with the rest of the skin to the best of my ability.

If there are any bugs(there shouldn't be any) or helpful comments, please direct them to 'magic_weaver@earthling.net'
