"Kaamos" is the Finnish name for the long winter night experienced in Finland,
Scandanavia, Alaska and other far northern climes.  Thanks to Samu Syrjä
<ssyrja@lpt.fi> for the name and inspiration.  The background is a photo of
mine, altered (of course) with the Gimp.  It was taken in 1993 in a town called 
Alapaha in south Georgia.  An alternate background, style file, and menu back are included in the theme package.
